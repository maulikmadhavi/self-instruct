If you take all the stars and count them, there are more than 10^22 of them. That's a lot!\n4) The universe is 13.8 billion years old. If you add up all the time since the Big Bang, you get about 14 billion years.\n5) The universe is very big. It takes light 100,000 years to travel across the universe.\n6) The universe is mostly dark energy and dark matter. We can't see this stuff, but we know it exists because of how it affects other things.\n7) The universe is expanding faster than the speed of light.
